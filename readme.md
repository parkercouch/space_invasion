# Space Invasion (But not really)
Just playing around with Phaser.io

The game currently has lots of enemies and you can shoot them.

There are no levels and no way to win. 

# Assignment Below:
# Phaser.io Example

Phaser is a JavaScript library that makes using HTML5 canvas-based games easy to do by taking a lot of the tedious work out of it and providing stuff like basic physics and collision detection.

## What's included?

* HTML layout is done (just add game div!)
* Scripts/links to bootstrap, phaser, and sweet alerts
* Audio assets
* Images, Sprites, and Spritesheets
* Bootstrap and Simple Layout

## What's not included?

JavaScript. You gotta write that.

## Why are we doing this?

* Use of physics library
* Built-in collision detection
* Object-oriented programming
* Using localStorage
* Not having to deal directly with canvas/redrawing
* Fun?
